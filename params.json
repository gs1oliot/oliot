It provides APIs for filtering and grouping radio frequency identification (RFID) based data. Clients of Oliot-fc can define filtering and grouping pattern according to EPCglobal ALE interface, and the result is returned back to them.\r\n\r\nLLRPReader--+---cxxtest-4.3 (cxxtest framework)  \r\n                                +---libs (pre-built libraries for LLRPReader)  \r\n                                +---LLRP_Reader (Reader impl)  \r\n                                +---LTK (XML2, LTKCPP Library)  \r\n                                +---PR9200_rfid (PR9200 Library)  \r\n                                +---target (build output folder of LLRP Reader and Stubappexample)  \r\n                                +---Tests (cxxtest testsuites)  \r\n \r\nYou can refer Doxygen document in following URL\r\nhttp://~~URL\r\nDEVELOPER GUIDE\r\nThis section is for the developers.\r\n \r\nDOWNLOAD & COMPILATION\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n1. Install Boost Library\r\nhttp://www.boost.org/\r\nversion: 1.54 or above\r\n \r\n2. Install build tools as follows.\r\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++6\r\nsudo ldconfig\r\n \r\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\r\nsudo apt-get install automake\r\nsudo apt-get install autoconf\r\nsudo apt-get install libtool\r\nsudo apt-get install xsltproc\r\n \r\n3. Use make command according to the arch type you want to build for.\r\nx86_64: make ARCH=x86_64 all\r\narm-generic-linux-gnueabi: make ARCH=arm all\r\narm-fsl-linux-gnueabi: make ARCH=armfs all\r\ni386: make ARCH=i386 all\r\n* Because -m32 option was not used for x86_64, x86_64/i386 cannot be built in 32bit/64bit computer.\r\n \r\nEach build options cannot coexist, so you should ‘make ARCH=(arch_type) clean’ before you run one of above.\r\n \r\n4. Executables would be generated in the ‘target’ folder. You can run them as follows.\r\n i) Using LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\nSet the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the path of boost, LTK, xml2, and other generated library files. You can refer to the run.sh in the project root folder.\r\n \r\nThe examples of required library paths for fridge app are follows. If you built it in the machine you would use, then use former one. If you cross-compiled it for arm, then use latter one.\r\nXML2: libxml2.so (ex. ./LTK/opensource/.libs or ./lib/arm)\r\nBoost Library: libboost_***.so (ex. /usr/local/lib or ./lib/arm)\r\nLLRP Wrapper: libllrpreader.so (ex. ./target)\r\nPR9200 API: librfid_pr9200.so (ex. ./target)\r\n \r\n ii) Copying library files\r\nSet LD_LIBARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and copy all required library files and configuration files into ‘target’ directory and run in that directory. All libraries should be exist in the current working directory.\r\n \r\n5. When you run the executables, you should set the options as follows. You can see options\r\n./stubappexample -c<path-to-reader.cfg> -l<path-to-config.llrp>\r\n \r\n6. You can change configuration of reader by modifying reader.cfg file in the root folder.\r\n \r\nPROJECT SUMMARIES\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n \r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
