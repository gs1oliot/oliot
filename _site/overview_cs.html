<h1>Oliot Cloud Development</h1>

<p>Oliot-cloudstack is an implementation for running Oliot components on Cloud. Currently, the implementation supports a load predictor and TCP connection migration through SSH commands parsing from client to server. This is currently intended for developers only, as the client has to depend on the management &amp; hypervisor serversâ€™ configurations. Later version may provide an interface for easier client deployment.</p>
