<p>Oliot-fc is an implementation of EPCglobal application level events (ALE) interface. It provides APIs for filtering and grouping radio frequency identification (RFID) based data. Clients of Oliot-fc can define filtering and grouping pattern according to EPCglobal ALE interface, and the result is returned back to them.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">DOWNLOAD &amp; COMPILATION</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Install Boost Library
http://www.boost.org/
version: 1.54 or above</p></li>
<li><p>Install build tools as follows.
sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
sudo ldconfig</p></li>
</ol>

<p>sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install automake
sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install libtool
sudo apt-get install xsltproc</p>

<ol>
<li>Use make command according to the arch type you want to build for.
x86<em>64: make ARCH=x86</em>64 all
arm-generic-linux-gnueabi: make ARCH=arm all
arm-fsl-linux-gnueabi: make ARCH=armfs all
i386: make ARCH=i386 all</li>
<li>Because -m32 option was not used for x86<em>64, x86</em>64/i386 cannot be built in 32bit/64bit computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each build options cannot coexist, so you should ‘make ARCH=(arch_type) clean’ before you run one of above.</p>

<ol>
<li>Executables would be generated in the ‘target’ folder. You can run them as follows.
i) Using LD<em>LIBRARY</em>PATH
Set the LD<em>LIBRARY</em>PATH environment variable to the path of boost, LTK, xml2, and other generated library files. You can refer to the run.sh in the project root folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>The examples of required library paths for fridge app are follows. If you built it in the machine you would use, then use former one. If you cross-compiled it for arm, then use latter one.
XML2: libxml2.so (ex. ./LTK/opensource/.libs or ./lib/arm)
Boost Library: libboost<em>***.so (ex. /usr/local/lib or ./lib/arm)
LLRP Wrapper: libllrpreader.so (ex. ./target)
PR9200 API: librfid</em>pr9200.so (ex. ./target)</p>

<p>ii) Copying library files
Set LD<em>LIBARY</em>PATH=./:$LD<em>LIBRARY</em>PATH, and copy all required library files and configuration files into ‘target’ directory and run in that directory. All libraries should be exist in the current working directory.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you run the executables, you should set the options as follows. You can see options
./stubappexample -c<path-to-reader.cfg> -l<path-to-config.llrp></p></li>
<li><p>You can change configuration of reader by modifying reader.cfg file in the root folder.</p></li>
</ol>
