<p>Object Name Service (ONS) is service look-up system on top of Directory Naming Service (DNS). It is located in higher layer of EPC global architecture [http://www.gs1.org/epcglobal]. Briefly, this service have a responsibility of looking up services related to given Electronic Product Code (EPC).</p>

<p>It should be noted that ONS fully leverages DNS. As a service publisher, you need to add/delete/update service lists related to give EPC as a NAPTR Record form [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2915.txt], leading clients to obtain them by ordinary DNS query (e.g. <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jndi-resources-howto.html">Java JNDI</a>.</p>
